    <h1>Linda Fernsel</h1>
    <p>
      Linda is studying computer science and media.
      She writes her Bachelor Thesis about <a href="https://github.com/LiFaytheGoblin/Gender-Equality-in-CS-Publications">Gender Equality in Computer Science Publications</a>.
      When she is not studying she teaches others how to program or makes web apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda thinks the best things about being a programmer are (a) the possibility to create something beautiful and meaningful together
      and (b) going beyond what she thought she could do.
