Wohoo! I restyled my blog - doesn't this look so much better than before?

<p><small>(This post will be incredibly short.)</small></p>

<p>I am happy to see that I am making progress. When I restyled my blog I thought and learned a lot about...</p>
<ul>
<li> ... colors and color shemes</li>
<li> ... where to place which elements</li>
<li> ... jQuery! I love it and I am definetely going to learn more about that!</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for now :3</p>
