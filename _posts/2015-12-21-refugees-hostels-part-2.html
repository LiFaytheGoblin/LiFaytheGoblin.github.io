title: Refugees' Hostels II.
---
Here's part two of the list of shocking things plus I'll tell you how learning German works for refugees at the local Refugees' Hostel.

<ol>
<li>The lack of psychological treatment </li>
<li>and it's fatal consequences (untreated breathing problems and abortion)</li>
<li>How many people already got jobs </li>
<li>and how employers make use of their situation (not speaking German very well, needing a job asap), 
so way too many refugees get fooled by employers and don't get paid appopriately or they don't get paid at all 
(this is called slavery btw and it is FORBIDDEN).</li>
<li>How complicated German bureaucracy really is.</li>
<li>How isolated the hostel is and how much influence the position of the hostel has on integration.</li>
<li>That people spread wrong rumors to harm refugees.</li>
</ol>

<h3>And now for how learning German works for refugees at my refugees' hostel.</h3>
<p>First of all: There is a huge lack of teachers. Most lessons are done by people like you and me, without the knowledge of how to teacher
German as a foreign language. This is pretty bad, but better than nothing. In my refugees' hostel, there are no wifi and no computers and only few have a smartphone.
So people can't really learn on their own. There's not enough books either. So after lessons, people go back to their everyday life and speak
in their native language to each other. Plus German is known as a hard language and many people need to learn a whole new alphabet or have
never been to a school (and thus can't read or write). Conclusion: Learning German takes long. Exception: Children. Seriousely, sending kids to
school in Germany with German kids is the best thing you can do for them to learn the language quickly and to get integrated.</p>
