title: Ranting Mood
---
I've been in a ranting mood lately, and this is why.

<p>It's a disgrace and an insult that Europe is betraying itself and humanity while going through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" target="_blank">refugee crisis</a>. 
Today, at Holocaust Memorial Day, we praise the countries who welcomed refugees of the Shoa during the Nazi dictatorship, but:</p>
<ul>
<li> we set limits on how many refugees we save - this means we accept that the others die </li>
<li> we <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-5" target="_blank">threaten to throw Greece out of Schengen</a> because they decide not to just watch people drown in the sea but to save them instead </li>
<li> we sit and watch while <a href="http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-11/anti-immigrant-violence-germany" target="_blank">Nazis are attacking refugee's hostels</a> </li>
<li> we're <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/pubs-and-clubs-in-german-town-of-freiburg-forbid-refugees/a-19000800" target="_blank">forbidding young, male people who "look like a refugee" to enter specific areas</a> such as clubs (reminds you of something?)*</li>
<li> to stop refugees, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34957830" target="_blank">we pay the Turkish government</a> who is violating human rights and ignores the freedom of press - not only do we not stand up against these crimes, but we actively support them</li>
</ul>

* The reason for this is because people with that appearance have sexually harassed women. This is horrible of course. But it doesn't mean that 
a) the majority of young male refugees does that (I work with refugees - and neither I nor any other woman working here has ever been harassed)
b) we can discriminate a whole group of people
