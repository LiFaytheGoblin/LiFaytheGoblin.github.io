title: Refugees' Hostels
---
I thought I knew what German asylum seekers' hostels were like until I started to regularily visit some. 
Here are just a few things that shocked me (some in a positive, some in a negative way).

<ol>
<li>The selfie a Syrian refugee took when successfully arriving in Greece by boat</li>
<li>And the photos of his friends who didn't make it.</li>
<li>The dentist from Aleppo who doesn't know when he'll be able to see his family again.</li>
<li>That the Albanian family you made friends with will be thrown out</li>
<li>And how much the kids have changed since they've heard about this.</li>
<li>Racism that exists between refugees of different nationalities and skin color.</li>
<li>That refugees have to live in rooms of three for an unknown time, waiting, sometimes for eight years.</li>
<li>That while I have a good life just because I'm European the 19 year old from Gambia has to go through such a mess</li>
<li>And that she doesn't plan on giving up.</li>
<li>The kids who already know German very well although they've just arrived.</li>
</ol>
