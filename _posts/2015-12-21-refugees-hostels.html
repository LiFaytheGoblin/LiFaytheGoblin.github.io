I thought I knew what German asylum seekers' hostels were like until I started to regularily visit one. 
Here are just a few things that shocked me (some in a positive, some in a negative way). Below you'll find a short abstract about how 
refugees in my local refugees' hostel learn German.

<ol>
<li>The selfie a Syrian refugee took when successfully arriving in Greece by boat</li>
<li>And the photos of his friends who didn't make it.</li>
<li>The dentist from Aleppo who doesn't know when he'll be able to see his family again.</li>
<li>That the Albanian family you made friends with will be thrown out</li>
<li>And how much the kids have changed since they've heard about this.</li>
<li>Racism that exists between refugees of different nationalities and skin color.</li>
<li>That refugees have to live in rooms of three for an unknown time, waiting, sometimes for eight years.</li>
<li>That while I have a good life just because I'm European the 19 year old from Gambia has to go through such a mess</li>
<li>And that she doesn't plan on giving up.</li>
<li>The kids who already know German very well although they've just arrived.</li>
<li>The lack of psychological treatment </li>
<li>and it's fatal consequences (untreated breathing problems and abortion)</li>
<li>How many people already got jobs </li>
<li>and how employers make use of their situation (not speaking German very well, needing a job asap), 
so way too many refugees get fooled by employers and don't get paid appopriately or they don't get paid at all 
(btw. this is called slavery and it is FORBIDDEN).</li>
<li>How complicated German bureaucracy really is.</li>
<li>How isolated the hostel is and how much influence the position of the hostel has on integration.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do Refugees learn German?</h3>
<p>First of all: There is a huge lack of teachers. Most lessons are done by people like you and me, without the knowledge of how to teachGerman as a foreign language. This is pretty bad, but better than nothing. In my refugees' hostel, there are no wifi and no computers and only few have a smartphone.
So people can't really learn on their own. There's not enough books either. So after lessons, people go back to their everyday life and speak
in their native language to each other. Plus German is known as a hard language and many people need to learn a whole new alphabet or have
never been to a school (and thus can't read or write). Conclusion: Learning German takes long. Exception: Children. Seriousely, sending kids to
school in Germany with German kids is the best thing you can do for them to learn the language quickly and to get integrated.</p>
