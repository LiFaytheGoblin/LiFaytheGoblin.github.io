title: 2015 Was Fun
---
I truly loved the year 2015 - it was fun, inspiring and exciting. And this is why:

<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>In spring I passed my final exams and got my German and French high school diploma, what felt really relieving. 
I also found a university of applied sciences where I'd love to study - it's great to have something to look forward to.
Oh, and I had a great time at the <a href="http://scratch-dach.info/wiki/Scratch-Day_2015_in_Bochum">German Scratch Wiki Day</a>!</p>

<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>In summer I helped organize the <a href="http://www.scratch2015ams.org/">Scratch2015AMS Conference</a>. I loved the organizing meetings in Paris and Amsterdam and working with
a great team of people. Scratch Conferences are my favorite part of the year and participating again, meeting many cool Scratchers
and being overwhelmed by all the creative and new things I saw was just awesome!</p>

<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>In autumn I had much free time since I didn't start studying yet. I used that time to relax, to create a Scratch Workshop (which was also my
first paid job ever), to get more active in my local <a href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> and to start helping out at a refugees' hostel. On the brink of winter I went to a 
Spanish Language School in Spain for a month, where I enjoyed the great weather and nature. It was a valuable time of experiences and getting to 
know myself better.</p>

<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>In winter I got my second paid job ever which is also the best job in the world: I joined the <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Team">Scratch Team</a> as a (remote) Community Moderator.
Even after all my time with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, this was still a big step for me and I still can't believe it. It was also very confusing to understand
how the German law for such things works and I think I've learned a lot from dealing with that.</p>

<h3>I want to thank everyone who was involved in making my year that awesome.
It wouldn't have worked without you.</h3>
