I am afraid I couldn't decide on a title for this text, so feel free to chose either from this list below or invent your own:

<ul>
<li> “Our adventures are stars we cannot fathom into constellations” <small>(based on John Green, “The fault in our stars”)</small></li>
<li> A non-psychologist makes a fascinating discovery</li>
<li> My adventurous childhood</li>
<li> How I ended up having such a cool life</li>
<li> Why I love Scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, I hope you found a title you like, because I would like to continue, since I've quite a lot to say. Let me explain my situation.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks ago, it was a Saturday, I've been cleaning up my room, throwing old things away, finding some folders filled with memories from 
my childhood, which I remember, was adventurous and wonderful. At approximately 12:28am, I was suddenly hit by a whole new perspective. 
The things I had found were dots which formed, like in Seurat's pointilism, a picture you can only see if you step away from it. 
And now that I am on the brink of becoming an adult, I think I have gained enough distance to these dots that seemed so random at first. 
This discovery is such a fascinating experience, that I really feel like sharing it with others. 
But for you to see the picture too, you need to know about the dots first.
</p>

<p>
We were barely done with kindergarten when my best friend and I started to invent exercises for each other and later for my brother as well. 
We made up our own mathematical rules because we didn't know the „real“ rules yet. 
We tested each others spelling skills while at the same time making horrible mistakes in the task description. 
We created quizzes and exercises, where you'd have to imagine and draw something. I always loved sharing my knowledge with others and
today I do what I did when I was 6 years old: I teach others in a Wiki, Scratch Workshops and a CoderDojo.
</p>

<p>
I also invented something called „multidimensional thinking“. I tried to teach it to me and my brother with exercises like thinking „No“ 
and „Yes“ at the same time. So I discovered what today I call “concentration”. It turned out, well, 
this is more or less what you do with your mind when you're totally absorbed by some program you're writing and 
you're concentrating so much that you got out of the state of thinking and into the state of knowing.

		Phew. Now this was deep. Back to being childish: We kids were always living in our own world, constantly role-playing. 
		Until the age of 8 or so, we role-played in the worlds created by Astrid Lindgren, who is, 
		in my opinion the best author of children books the universe has ever seen – read her books if you didn't do it when you were a child! 
		So, we were trapped in these worlds, but we did not limit ourselves to that. We invented new characters, locations and adventures, 
		all done spontaneously. We build our own constructs of ideas on her worlds like we nowadays play Minecraft. 
		We remixed Astrid Lingrens worlds like today I remix other people's projects. 
		</p>

		<p>
		After the worlds of Pippi Longstocking and Emil of Lönneberga, in third grade we discovered a whole new world: 
		J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. We made a mod with tons of extra features (Hermione's little sister, 
		Dumbledore's marriage with McGonagall, ...) and from now on, in our school you could learn how to perform magic and how to play Quidditch, 
		the only sport I ever truly loved. We would always win against Slytherin. While defeating evil in role-playing, we also wrote fanfic 
		without even knowing what that was. We never got very far with our “book”, but it improved our writing skills a lot – 
		And it made us very passionate about creating our own worlds, without remixing, so we left Hogwarts and moved on to unknown stories. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Our real-life-dreaming was still mainly role-playing, but at some point it got more serious with actual writing attempts: 
		The girls living on a farm, taking care of many beautiful horses, which in school evolved into 
		a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Offline Role-Playing Game). Then there were Franzi and her friends, 
		who discovered a dangerous place named „triangle of shadows“ and eventually also met lots of ghosts and defeated Death, 
		who happened to be some weird hitchhiker. And, back to the roots, we became more educational again: 
		„Superhäschen Minimax“, our attempt to write a children book about a humanified little rabbit with super powers. 
		Remember, we were around 12 years old at that time. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Finally, there was yet another turn in my life: I started to watch Pokemon. 
		I - and other people that had the misfortune to spend time with me - soon designed our own Pokemon and Pokemon characters, 
		and (surprise!) role-playing started again. I have one giant folder full of Pokemon sketches and ... drawings of my first algorithms. 
		Yes, my first algorithms. Yes, mostly drawn algorithms. I don't know how familiar you are with Pokemon, 
		but maybe you know that you can't only fight but also do contests. In these contests, you invent a beautiful performance 
		for your Pokemon who will then make a great show with lots of special effects. I planned these performances, using Pokemon attacks, 
		which are, in a certain way like commands you give the computer. And of course you had to do it step by step so the Pokemon, 
		the computer, understands and does exactly what you want. I even found if-conditions in my planning.

So, by that time, Pokemon had become a great hype in my school. Everyone now played it on the Nintendo console. 
And this is where I discovered non-analog, pre-made games. After my friends convinced me, 
that Pokemon games were not just for boys (got you, evil stereotypes, muhaha), I got a game for myself. And more games. And more. 
</p>

<p>
And at some point, I found Scratch, the last dot of this picture and a tool that allowed me to make my own non-analog games. 
Games like Pokemon. How could I have resisted?
</p>

<p>
(Don't expect a nice transitional paragraph here - I am not THAT creative.)
</p>

<p>
So, I hope you enjoyed this little story about my childhood adventures. If you haven't noticed it yet, let me point out for you, 
which dots we actually have got here. We have:
<ul>
<li> fantasy</li>
<li> role-playing/acting</li>
<li> teaching</li>
<li> writing</li>
<li> designing</li>
<li> drawing</li>
<li> computational thinking</li>
<li> encountering stereotypes</li>
<li> games</li>
</ul>
And then:
<ul>
<li> programming</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You could also say, these dots are stars which until I now only knew the names of, but that afternoon I was able fathom 
them into a constellation – The constellation of who I am today. (How poetic.)
</p>

<p>
I really hope I encouraged you to think about your own childhood adventures and how in fact, 
all the little stories draw the picture of the person you are today. No really, think about it. It's fascinating.
