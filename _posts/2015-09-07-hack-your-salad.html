		<p>After you've seen that picture on the left, you certainly are hungry. So let's start right away to not waste any of your precious time. </p>

		<p>To make a dressing, add 2 spoons of vinegar, 4 spoons of water, 1 spoon of sunflower oil, ...blablabla..., salt and some "Maggi seasoning sauce".</P>

		<p>If you don't have Maggi, I'm sorry for you. Maybe you have some other 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggi#Seasoning_sauce" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank">
		"dark, soy sauce-type hydrolysed vegetable protein-based condiment sauce"</a>. Or, according to 
		<a href="http://www.amerika-forum.de/threads/81350-maggi-gibts-einen-ersatz" title="Amerika-Forum" target="_blank">this site</a>, 
		you can also use "Bragg's Liquid Aminos" (whatever that is supposed to be).</p>

		<p>Blablabla... Anyway. Now mix everything, fill it in a bowl and add (well washed!) lettuce.</p>

		<p>Oh man that was boring, huh?</p>

		<p>No worries, now comes the magic. Or part of it. It's name is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argan_oil" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank">argan oil</a>". 
		Add a small spoon of that to your magic potion - uh - your salad.
		Now grab some tasty herbs like chives, parsley and lovage. Cut them into very small pieces and add them to your elixir.
		Also add some pieces of your favorite kinds of nuts. Good, we're almost done. See how it bubbles and steams? Okay, me neither.
		Anyway, last but not least: Take a few delicious sweet dates, cut them into pieces and with a solemn jerk, throw them onto your salad.
		And that's it!</p>

		<p>Now you know how to make a super fancy and yummi salad that will not only impress your stomach, but also your family and friends (cats excluded).</p>

		<p>And don't even think about just following this recipe. Get creative and invent your own salad!</p>
