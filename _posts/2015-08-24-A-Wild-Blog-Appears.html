title: A Wild Blog Appears!
---

<p>At about 5pm today I realized I haven't had lunch today. The reason? The reason?? This blog, obviously.</p>

<p>But seriously, what is an empty stomach compared to all the advantages I benefit of thanks to this blog? 
Not only have I learned how to use GitHub, GitHub Pages and Jekyll, I've also refreshed my HTML and CSS skills!
And since I've decided to write this blog in english, I'll also practise my language skills, now isn't that handy!
(I am not going to apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes I make - If you have a problem with my english, the repository for this blog is here: <a href="https://github.com/LiFaytheGoblin/LiFaytheGoblin.github.io">https://github.com/LiFaytheGoblin/LiFaytheGoblin.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my blog at least one quarter as much as I do, and if you notice anything odd, don't hesitate to tell me about it!</p>
